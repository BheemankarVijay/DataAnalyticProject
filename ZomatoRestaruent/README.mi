📌 Project Overview

This project explores the Zomato Restaurant dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The main objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand restaurant trends, customer behavior, pricing, and ratings.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains the following columns:

name → Restaurant name

online_order → Whether online ordering is available (Yes/No)

book_table → Whether table booking is available (Yes/No)

rate → Customer rating (needs cleaning, e.g. "4.1/5" → 4.1)

votes → Number of customer votes

approx_cost(for two people) → Approximate cost for two people (needs cleaning to numeric)

listed_in(type) → Category of restaurant (e.g., Delivery, Buffet, Drinks & Nightlife)

🔧 Data Cleaning

Removed/handled missing values in rate and approx_cost.

Cleaned rate column (removed “NEW”, “-”, etc.).

Converted approx_cost(for two people) into numeric format.

Renamed columns for easier coding.

Checked and removed duplicates.

📊 EDA & Visualizations

Univariate Analysis

Distribution of restaurant types (listed_in(type))

Count of restaurants offering online ordering and table booking

Distribution of ratings and votes

Bivariate Analysis

Impact of online ordering on ratings

Relationship between votes and ratings

Average cost vs rating

Table booking availability vs rating

Feature Engineering

Created price_category (Low / Medium / High) based on approx_cost

Visualizations Used

Countplot, Barplot, Boxplot, Violinplot

Histogram, Scatterplot, Pie chart

📌 Insights

Restaurants offering online orders and table booking generally receive higher ratings.

Premium restaurants (High cost) tend to have better ratings, but not always higher votes.

Delivery-based restaurants dominate the dataset compared to fine dining/nightlife.

Customer votes are positively correlated with ratings but show outliers.

✅ Conclusion

This project gave hands-on experience in data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and extracting insights from a real-world restaurant dataset.
The analysis helps understand customer preferences and market patterns in the restaurant industry.
